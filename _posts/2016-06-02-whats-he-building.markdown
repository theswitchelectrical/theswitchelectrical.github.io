Now what's that sound from under the door? He's pounding nails into a hardwood floor... And I swear to god I heard someone moaning low... And I keep seeing the blue light of a T.V. show...

He has a router, and a table saw... And you won't believe what Mr. Sticha saw. There's poison underneath the sink of course... But there's also enough formaldehyde to choke a horse... What's he building In there. What the hell is he building in there?

I heard he has an ex-wife in some place called Mayors Income, Tennessee. And he used to have a consulting business in Indonesia... But what is he building in there?

What the hell is building in there?
